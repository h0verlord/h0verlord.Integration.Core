Hey,

In order to start using this framework, you'll need to do some configuration.

1. Check the App.config and fill in all the neccessary values for URLs, etc.
2. If you're using proxy, please make sure you're using ClientType.Proxy in the CreateRequest.cs ctor.
3. Check the nuget packages, make sure everything's updated.
4. Two sample objects for request and response are prepared in the Objects folder.
5. GL and HF.

Thanks for using this framework. If it blows up, you don't know me.
