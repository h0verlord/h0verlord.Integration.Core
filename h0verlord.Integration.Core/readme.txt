Hey,

In order to start using this framework, you'll need to do some configuration.

1. Check the App.config and fill in all the neccessary values for URLs, etc.
2. Also check any duplicities if you had previous versions of the framework.
3. Check the nuget packages, make sure everything's updated.
4. Two sample objects for request and response are prepared in the Objects folder.
5. Class ExampleTests serves as an example of usage and how to create a request, rename it or don't use it.
 - It is not in the WIKI, because apparently I am too lazy.
5. GL and HF.

Thanks for using this framework. If it blows up, you don't know me, so...
